///// PROGRESS SUMMARY LOG /////
    04-14-21: Made a fun onboarding page that slides up and off-screen on first filter menu button click.

    04-14-21: Spent nearly the whole day on fine-tuning base styling and functionality. It's finally done! Now to get started with media queries...

    04-13-21: Mostly finished setting up enlarged details modal.

    04-13-21: Set up Netlify continuous deployment: ga-rvgg.netlify.app.

    04-13-21: Mostly finished adding API request data to cards, and adjusted styling to work for the images' aspect ratio a little better.

    04-13-21: Feeling really good today. Got my coffee and I'm hitting the ground running. Should have MVPs done by this afternoon.

    04-12-21: Made a ton of progress. Got the filters modal working as intended, and made functions to parse the filters into pieces of data that are usable for the API request..

    04-12-21: Brain seems to be working properly today. Starting off the day by fine tuning search filters.

    04-11-21: Having a really difficult time focusing on any given task. I suspect this might be a lingering side-effect from the COVID vaccine. Shelving the video game UI for now.

    04-10-21: Turns out the animation was breaking because I was adding an extra comma in the CSS... marking the line in style/main.css.

    04-10-21: Struggling to get the card flip animation working. Strangely enough, it works if I paste it directly from W3Schools, but it refuses to work if I write my own code.

    04-09-21: Set up project Trello board to keep tasks and ideas organized.

    04-09-21: Created a GitHub repository and cloned it to my computer. Trying out having multiple css and javascript folders to keep sections of code organized.

    04-09-21: IGDB, Twitch's gaming database API, is being really finicky with lots of 404 errors. Found a good substitute in RAWG.

    04-09-21: Developed ideas for potential web apps for project 1 and settled for a sort of database/museum type app that will allow users to pull up information on a limited scope of video games.
